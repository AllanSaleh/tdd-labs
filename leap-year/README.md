# Leap Year

## Leap year

> A leap year is a calendar year containing one additional day  added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical or seasonal year.

The Gregorian reform modified the Julian calendar's scheme of leap years as follows:

> Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years, but the years 1600 and 2000 were.

Write a function `bool isLeapYear(int)` which returns true if the given year is a leap year and false otherwise.
