# TDD Labs

Problems and solutions for TDD labs.

## Labs

Currently we have the following labs:

* [test-leapyear](leap-year/README.md) - Leap Year
* [test-income-tax](income-tax/README.md) - Income tax calculator

# How To Test-Drive

* Develop iteratively
* Follow the TDD cycle of __RED, GREEN, REFACTOR__
    - __RED__ - Think of one simple example of how the system should be used
    - __GREEN__ - Add just enough code to make the test pass
    - __REFACTOR__ - Make the system code as well as tests easier to change.
* If working in a group or pairs, it's common for _each participant to do a full TDD cycle, rotating after a failing test_ has been written.
